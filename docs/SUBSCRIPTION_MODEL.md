## Monetization Strategy

### Revenue Model
- **Primary:** Monthly/annual subscriptions ($4.99/$39.99)
- **Secondary:** Ad revenue from free users (Google AdSense)

### Target Conversion Rate
- **Free to Premium:** 5-10% (industry standard for freemium apps)
- **Monthly to Annual:** 40% (incentivized by 33% discount)

### Projected Revenue (Year 1)
Assuming 1,000 users after 6 months:
- **Free users:** 900 (90%)
- **Premium users:** 100 (10%)
  - Monthly: 60 users × $4.99 = $299/month
  - Annual: 40 users × $39.99/12 = $133/month
- **Total MRR:** ~$432/month
- **Ad revenue:** ~$50-100/month (900 free users)
- **Total:** ~$500/month = $6,000/year

Assuming 5,000 users after 12 months:
- **Free users:** 4,500 (90%)
- **Premium users:** 500 (10%)
  - Total MRR: ~$2,160/month
  - Ad revenue: ~$250/month

## Implementation Notes

### Subscription Status Tracking
```typescript
enum SubscriptionTier {
  free
  premium
  lifetime
}

enum SubscriptionStatus {
  active      // Paying customer
  cancelled   // End of billing period
  past_due    // Payment failed
}
```

### Access Control Pattern
```typescript
// Middleware for API routes
export async function requirePremium(req: Request) {
  const user = await requireAuth(req);
  const subscription = await getUserSubscription(user.id);

  if (!isPremiumUser(subscription)) {
    throw new Error('Premium subscription required');
  }

  return user;
}

// React component gating
<PremiumGate fallback={<UpgradeCTA />}>
  <AICoachWidget />
</PremiumGate>
```

## FAQs

**Q: What happens to my data if I downgrade from Premium to Free?**
A: All your data is preserved. You'll just see stats calculated from your last 20 rounds instead of all-time. Your full history is still saved and will be available again if you re-upgrade.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes, cancel anytime. You'll have access to premium features until the end of your billing period.

**Q: What's the difference between monthly and annual?**
A: Annual saves you 33% ($39.99/year vs $59.88 for monthly). That's 2 months free!

**Q: How does the 20-round limit work for free users?**
A: Free users can log unlimited rounds, but dashboard statistics are calculated using only your most recent 20 rounds. Premium users get stats calculated from their entire history.

**Q: Do achievements carry over if I upgrade?**
A: Yes! All your bronze/silver/gold achievements are preserved, and you'll immediately unlock the ability to earn platinum and diamond tiers.
